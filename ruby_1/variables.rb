# naming variable in ruby:
# 1. Variable names should start with a lower case letter, capial letters are
#    reserved for contants which are not supposed to change.
# 2. Variables names can't start with a number but can have a number after the
#    the first letter
# 3. You can't have a space in the variable name
# 4. If you have multiple words in the variable name it's recommend to use
#    snake_case naming convention
first_name = 'Tam'
